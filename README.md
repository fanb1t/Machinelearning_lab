# üß† Machine Learning Labs

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn patterns and make predictions from data without being explicitly programmed. As more training data is provided, the model refines its parameters automatically and delivers increasingly accurate results.

## üîç Topics to Learn 

- **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled data to make predictions or classifications (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines)
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Discovering hidden patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., k‚ÄëMeans Clustering, Principal Component Analysis)

## üìåüó∫Ô∏è Roadmap to learn ML (based on [The Roadmap for Mastering Machine Learning in 2025](https://machinelearningmastery.com/roadmap-mastering-machine-learning-2025/))

1. **Learn Mathematics and Probability**
    - **Linear Algebra**: Learn vectors, matrices, matrix operations, eigenvalues, and singular value decomposition.
    - **Calculus**: Learn derivatives, gradients, and optimization techniques.
    - **Probability and Statistics**: Focus on key concepts like Bayes‚Äô theorem, probability distributions, and hypothesis testing.

2. **Learn Programming**
    - **Python**: Familiarize yourself with Python programming language for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning tasks.
    **Librarieq**
        - **NumPy**: For numerical computations and array operations.
        - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
        - **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
        - **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.

    - **R**: Learn R for statistical analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling.

3. **Understand Key Concepts of Deep Learning**:At this step you already have enough knowledge of mathematics and programming, now you can easily start to learn the basics of machine learning. For that purpose, you must know there are three kinds of ML, Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement learning.

4. **Understand Key Concepts of Deep Learning**:It is a type of ML where a computer solves complex tasks using multiple layers of artificial neurons (neural networks).

5. **Choose a Specialization**
    - In Computer Vision, learn about GANs and the implementation of important tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, etc.
    - In NLP, study transformers such as BERT and GPT, and some techniques like text classification and sentiment analysis.

6. **Learn to Deploy ML models**: the next step is deploying it for others to use. The deployment involves making your model available through a web service or application so others can interact with it. Various tools can help you with this, such as Flask and FastAPI for creating REST APIs, Docker for containerizing your application, and cloud platforms like AWS/Azure for scalable deployment. These tools ensure that your model can run smoothly in different environments and handle multiple user requests.

7. **Build a Portfolio and Keep Learning**: Build a portfolio showcasing your best projects. Don‚Äôt forget to refresh your learning from time to time by building new projects, following key publications, and attending tech meetups.
