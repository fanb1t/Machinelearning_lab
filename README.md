# 🧠 Machine Learning Labs

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn patterns and make predictions from data without being explicitly programmed. As more training data is provided, the model refines its parameters automatically and delivers increasingly accurate results.

## 🔍 Topics to Learn 

- **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled data to make predictions or classifications (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines)
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Discovering hidden patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., k‑Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis)
